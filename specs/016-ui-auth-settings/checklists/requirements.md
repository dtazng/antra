- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows

## Notes

- Password-change endpoint (`PATCH /v1/auth/password`) is not in the existing backend spec (015-go-backend) and must be added as a new contract during planning.
- Quiet hours and data export in settings are explicitly scoped as placeholders for future iterations.
- Theme preference is intentionally local-only (not backend-synced) in this iteration.
